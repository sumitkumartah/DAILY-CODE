2535. Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array


OPTIMAL::

class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSum(int[] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        int sum=0;
        int sum1=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum+=nums[i];
            int val=nums[i];
            while(val>0)
            {
                sum1=sum1+val%10;
                val=val/10;
            }
        }
        return Math.abs(sum-sum1);
        
        
    }
}

Time complexity: O(N * D)
The time complexity of this code is O(N * D), where N is the length of the input array and D is the maximum number of digits in any element of the array. The outer loop runs N times, and the inner loop that extracts the digits of each element runs D times for each element. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N * D).

Space complexity: O(1)
The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
